\section{Introduction}
There are myriads of ways to deform a planar sheet without stretching or tearing it. One can bend it, fold it, or combine the two. Folding and bending isometries are different by nature, and historically speaking there is some dichotomy in the study of the two; Smooth bending deformations are typically studied in differential geometry \cite{do_carmo}, whereas straight folds are often explored in the field of computational origami \cite{origami_book}. Curved folded surfaces \cite{huffman} result as a combination of the two, as folding an inextensible sheet along a curve necessitates global bending around the crease.

Building curved folded sculptures is a manual and time consuming process, often done using an empirical trial and error approach  as little theory is known \cite{curved_review,huffmann_reconstructing}. Contrary to classical origami, bending and folding instructions are hard to write down and the fact that multiple creases need to fold simultaneously further complicates the process \cite{StringActuated:2017}. Artists often pre-crease the paper using a ball burnisher or a CNC plotter before carefully folding and bending it, making the process of exploration even slower. 

Albeit manual, slow, and exhaustive, playing with paper is currently the only option available for an explorer of curved folds. Existing works on modeling these surfaces are either limited to previously discovered sculptures \cite{curved_folding_kilian,StringActuated:2017} or model a small partial set of folded surfaces generated by reflections or rotational sweeps \cite{Mitani_ref,mitani2009design}. Modeling the folding process of novel forms remains a challenge \cite{curved_review}.

In this paper we set to develop the basic tools for unconstrained modeling of curved folds, set with the objective of aiding the exploration, analysis and study of new curved folded structures. Our work builds upon Discrete Orthogonal Geodesic Nets (DOGs) \cite{rabi18,rabi2018shape} as a discrete model for smooth developable surfaces. These are regular quadrilateral meshes with equal angles around each vertex, and unlike other computational models for developables do not suffer from locking of various deformation modes \cite{locking1,locking2,grin_shells}, are not fixed to predetermined rulings directions \cite{pottmann_new,curved_folding_kilian} (see Fig \figref{fig:rulings_problem_curve}) or require remeshing while deforming the surface \cite{StringActuated:2017,SchreckEG2017,Narain}. The regularity of the DOG meshing also simplifies various curved folding objectives. We represent curved folded models as piecewise smooth developable surfaces with boundary constraints pushing for equal discrete geodesic curvature along their intersections, as done in \cite{rabi2018shape}.

Methods that model the ruling directly need to remesh in order to be able to model these surfaces as the rulings can change drastically, connecting vertices at different patches to one another. Representing the curved folded as a piecewise DOG avoid the need in remeshing as a DOG is parameterized by intrinsics invariants: orthogonal geodesics, and does not explicitly encode the developable rulings in its mesh. }

In practice, deforming a piecewise DOG while keeping the geodesic boundary constraints does not usually results in a model that is folded along all creases (see \figref{fig:folded_and_not_folded}). Our primary goal is to study deformations that bend as well as fold along all creases of a piecewise DOG. Part of the difficulty of modeling these deformations stems from the need to fold all curves simultaneously starting from a flat configuration \cite{more_on_paper}. \secref{sec:setup} lays the setup for our work, including the problem definition, desedirata and the discrete model we build upon taken from \cite{rabi18,rabi2018shape}. At \secref{sec:folding} we look at the smooth and combinatorial degrees of freedom of curved foldings, detailing how a flat piecewise smooth developable surface is locally a bifurcation point between folded and unfolded configurations. Folding along a crease given one side of the surface is in fact a binary choice (see \figref{fig:folding_combinatorics}). We then give a simple discrete charecterization for this binary choice by looking at supporting planes along the creases, and objectives to control the basics of foldings: mountain/valley assignments and dihedral angles, as well as folding along straight creases. At \secref{sec:implementation} we translate these derivations into an optimizationa algorithm capable of enforcing folds while deforming a piecewise DOG. At \secref{sec:results} we model various curved folded surfaces.

%Section \secref{ At \secref{sec:app}, we show explore a variety of applications for our tools such as wallpaper curved foldings, folding, and modeling while dynamically changing the creased pattern.
