\section{Setup} \label{sec:pre}
\subsection{Definitions}
Throughout the paper we look at curved folded surfaces as piecewise $C^2$ developable surfaces, whose discontinuities are focused along creases. We assume that these creases are $C^2$ curves that may intersect one another, and we call these intersections \textit{crease vertices}. These curves segment the surface into various disconnected components, which we call curved patches. By our assumptions these curved patches remain $C^2$, i.e. though the folding operation creates discontinuities along patches, the patches viewed separately are deformed by $C^2$ deformations. Throughout the paper we will often visualize the crease pattern itself, i.e. the initial isometric flatten surface together with its curved creases (\figref{fig:crease_pattern}).

\subsection{Model}
We follow the work of \cite{rabi2018shape} by modeling each smooth patch as a discrete orthogonal geodesic net, and the entire surface by keeping appropriate boundary constraints between the patches and along the creases. We trivially extend it to support intersecting curves by adding grid lines at crease vertices (see \figref{fig:piecewise_dog_from_crease} and \figref{fig:curve_on_dog}).

\subsection{Desiredata}
Our goal is to develop tools for the exploration of curved folded shapes on top of piecewise DOGs by means of deformations. The most basic of them is a bias and an algorithm to prefer deformations that indeed fold the creases, over those that do not (see \figref{fig:folded_and_not_folded}). We also develop tools to control creases mountain/valley assignment, dihedral angles, and the ruling patterns along the surface. Our choices are guided by four ground rules for deforming DOGs:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Perform homotopy based optimization \label{homotopy_opt}
  \item Minimally constrain DOGs \label{minimal_const}
  \item Use accurate functionals \label{accurate_func}
  \item Use simple functionals
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Homotopy based optimization} is motivated both theoretically and empirically; Modeling DOGs requires solving highly constrained and non linear optimization problems, yet the theory of DOGs guarantees nearby solutions if one starts at a feasible point. In fact, generally the shape space of DOGs is a smooth manifold \cite{rabi2018shape}. This observation is worthwhile in practice; DOGs exploration was demonstrated to perform well using smooth flow, or homotopy based optimization methods both for handle based editing tasks as well for more complicated deformations such curve-constraining flows \cite{rabi2018shape}. \\
\textbf{Minimally constrain DOGs.} As DOGs are already heavily constrained, one needs to carefully choose which quantities to constrain by hard constraints, and which ones should be optimized using soft constraints. This is essential to avoid locking, or ill-posed problems in case the constraint gradients are linearly independent \cite{rabi2018shape}. In particular, the rigidity analysis in \cite{rabi18} demonstrates that one cannot fix all edge length exactly, or likewise demand a DOG to be chebyshev net. We note however that this can be done approximately and to a low tolerance, as a DOG is a chebyshev at the smooth limit and at the smooth limit there is a rich set of exact isometries. As we'll be seen at \secref{sec:folding}, folding constraints can be written as equalities but also as inequalities, the later are preferable since they can be satisfied \textit{exactly}, and since in practice they almost don't affect the optimization of already folded surfaces.\\
\textbf{Accurate functionals.} We look for constraints and objectives that are accurate and as often in the case with DOG objectives, converge under sampling of a smooth orthogonal geodesic net \cite{rabi18,rabi2018shape}. \\
\textbf{Simple funcationals.} We strongly prefer sparser objectives with a lower degree as possible. To that end, we leverage the regularity of the DOG meshing and the theory of smooth orthogonal geodesic net counterparts in our derivations. \\

%If $S$ is a curved folded surface with a given crease pattern, we call a crease \textit{active} at $S$ if there is a discontinuity along it.
