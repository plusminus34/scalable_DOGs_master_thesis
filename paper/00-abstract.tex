We present a set of computational tools for unhindered exploration of curved folded sculptures, based on piecewise discrete orthogonal geodesic nets (DOGs). Our main apparatus is a discrete binary characterization for folds between DOGs, along with a simple folding algorithm to simultaneously enforce folding movements while deforming planar sheets. We complement our folding algorithm with essential building blocks for curved folding deformations: objectives to control dihedral angles, straight creases, and mountain-valley assignments. We apply our machinery in a curved folding editing system, thus building the first tool capable of modeling bending and folding of complicated crease patterns.

% and explore areas previously uncharted by computer simulations such as wallpaper curved folding, as well as dynamically adding, removing, and moving creases along a flattened pattern.
