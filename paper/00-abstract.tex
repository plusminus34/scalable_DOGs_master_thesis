We present a computational framework for interactive design and exploration of curved folded surfaces. In current practice, such surfaces are typically created manually using physical paper, and hence our objective is to lay the foundations for the digitalization of curved folded surface design.
We base our approach on modeling the shapes using discrete orthogonal geodesic nets (DOGs) in a piecewise manner. DOGs are used to represent the smooth parts of the modeled shape, and we connect different DOGs along curves that represent the sharp creases and folds.
Our main contribution is a discrete binary characterization for folds between DOGs, accompanied by an algorithm to simultaneously fold creases and smoothly bend planar sheets. We complement our algorithm with essential building blocks for curved folding deformations: objectives to control dihedral angles and mountain-valley assignments. We apply our machinery to build the first interactive freeform editing tool capable of modeling bending and folding
of complicated crease patterns.
