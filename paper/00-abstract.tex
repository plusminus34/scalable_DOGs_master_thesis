We present a set of computational tools for unhindered exploration of curved folded sculptures, based on piecewise discrete orthogonal geodesic nets (DOGs). Our main apparatus is a discrete binary characterization for folds between DOGs accompanied with an algorithm to simultaneously fold creases while bending planar sheets. We complement our algorithm with essential building blocks for curved folding deformations: objectives to control dihedral angles, straight creases, and mountain-valley assignments. We apply our machinery in a curved folding editing system, thus building the first tool capable of modeling bending and folding of complicated crease patterns.

% and explore areas previously uncharted by computer simulations such as wallpaper curved folding, as well as dynamically adding, removing, and moving creases along a flattened pattern.
