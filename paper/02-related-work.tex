The beautiful art of curved folded sculptures is almost a hundred years old, dating back to the 1920's works of Josef Albers in the Bauhaus art school \cite{josef_albers_thesis}, and continuing with the investigations of David Huffman and Ron Resch in the 1970's \cite{huffman,resch1974portfolio}. %Many of these early works are mathematically not yet fully understood. %TODO. (some work has been done on specific models...$

%  We know what happens in one fold, but multiple ones still forms a challenge and we only have specific investigation for some cases. Creating them is , using paper and They date to 1920's but we only know what happen along one fold, or analyze specific set of examples, and don't know how typical models even fold. Computer simulations of that can help, but are somehow legging behind what is mostly experimented by hand, in a process that is in fact time consuming, often involving using a pen bla and da da da.
