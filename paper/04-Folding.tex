\section{Fundamental tools for folding} \label{sec:folding}
In this section, we explore the different ways one can fold a given crease pattern, and derive objectives to control them.

Choosing 2 different tangents along each 'side' of the curve creates discontinuities along the curve and a curved folded surface.}

%Two intersecting developable surfaces can be flattened along their intersection if the intersected curve have the same geodesic curvature on both surfaces. 
\subsection{The smooth and combinatorial parameters of a single crease}
A single straight crease is rather boring, mathematically speaking. Straight lines can only be folded as in classical origami, i.e. by keeping them straight \cite{demaine_lens}. Hence the folding process of a single fold can be described by a single real number, representing the constant dihedral angles between the nearby planes. There are far more degrees of freedom for folding a curved crease; Up to rigid motion, locally a folding can be exactly described by two smooth \textit{functions}: the curves' curvature $k(t) > k_g(t)$ and its torsion $\tau(t)$  \cite{more_on_paper, duncan_folded}. Indeed, let $\gamma(t)$ be a curve on a flattened crease pattern and $\Gamma(t)$ is its embedding in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Let $k(t)$ be the curvature of $\Gamma(t)$, and $k_g(t)$ the curvature of of $\gamma(t)$, i.e. the curve's geodesic curvature, such that $k_g(t) = k(t) \cos(\alpha(t))$. Assuming the curve along the surface is indeed bend such that $k(t) > k_g(t)$, then there are 2 distinct planes containing $\Gamma'(t)$ and forming an angle of $\alpha(t)$ with the curve's osculating plane. A curve folded surface is then a consistent smooth choice of a different tangent plane for each "side" of the curve, which are dependent on $k(t),\tau(t)$ (see Fig. \ref{fig:curved_fold_through_curve}). The tangent planes from both sides are reflections of one another through the osculating plane of the curve \cite{curved_folding_kilian}.
The folding angle of a curved crease can vary along the curve, and the ruling patterns can change during the deformation. The folded shape is locally not determined only by these two smooth functions as there is an additional \textit{combinatorial} degree of freedom: the choice of a surface at each side (see \figref{fig:curved_fold_through_curve}). There are four options, two of which creates creates discontinuity along the crease. %We call one folded configuration a mountain fold and the other a valley fold. %We follow \cite{demaine_lens} to distinguish between the two type of folded configurations by calling one choice a \textit{Mountain} fold and the other a \textit{Valley} fold. %We note that by \cite{demaine_lens}, a fold always consistently stays mountain/valley throughout the entire creased curve. Assuming a given normal orientation, a fold is said to be a mountain fold if the normal of the surface TODO:ADD EXPLANATION. 


%The curvature and torsion also dictates the ruling patterns of the developable surfaces, generally changing while folding and bending the surface. Deforming a curved crease locally determines the shape of both surfaces around it, and the exact regions of surfaces influenced by that fold depend on the ruling patterns themselves. As mentioned, the rulings patterns themselves can change which can smoothly change during the deformation itself. 

%(there's the cone singularity case where a curved fold is more local (as focused on the cone point) but I think this requires the curve to be C^1.. should mention it?

\subsection{The combinatorial parameters of multiple creases}
Curved folding is well understood locally, around a small part of a single curve, as the tangent planes along the curves are reflections of one another through the folded curve osculating plane. Understanding crease patterns globally still remains a challenge. In essence, deforming one patch propagates a global deformation of the patch on the other side of the crease, a process that depends on the ruling patterns. The ruling patterns are formed as the intersections of the tangent planes, and as mentioned the ruling patterns can smoothly change during the deformation itself. When there are multiple creases this process further propagate and dictates the shape of other patches (see \figref{fig:multiple_crease_pattern}). The process becomes more complicated when some creases intersect due to compatibility constraints (see \figref{fig:multiple_crease_pattern}, right figure). 

\begin{figure} [h]

\end{figure}

Generally speaking, one might be able to choose between 4 configurations of the surface at the first crease, but this choice already fixes a patch for nearby creases. The combinatorial degrees of freedom that then remain are whether each crease is active, i.e. folded, or not (see \figref{fig:folded_and_not_folded} ). With this in mind, we note the following observation:

\begin{theorem}\label{Thm:orth_geo_equiv}
A crease is 'active' on a given point along a crease curve if and only if at that point its osculating plane is locally a supporting plane for the surface (see \figref{fig:plane_side}).
\end{theorem}
This follows directly from the fact that the tangent planes along a crease are the same if it is smooth along it, but along a folded crease they are reflections of one another through the curve's osculating plane. As mentioned, there is often an extra combinatorial degree of freedom in choosing the type of fold, but generally only for one fold. We follow \cite{demaine_lens} to distinguish between the two type of folded configurations by calling one choice a \textit{Mountain} fold and the other a \textit{Valley} fold, distinguishing between a fold above and below the osculating plane for a given orientation. We note that by \cite{demaine_lens}, a fold always consistently stays mountain/valley throughout a bend curve, with a higher curvature than its flattening. %We also note that when the curvature of the curve is not larger than its geodesic curvature, one example being a flat patch, then the tangents from both sides are the same (we should maybe call it both active and not active for that configuration?


% Motivated by homotopy stuff, we look for a function F(t). Once a crease is active, there's no need to take care of it.

% The pictures which will show are then discrete, though the smooth picture is the same. Maybe put the discrete picture in the setup as well.
% A fold is active if nearby tangents are reflections of one another, and is not active if they are the same as there is no discontinuity. (have a figure that is discrete, but explain it is also the same drawing for the smooth case).
% Write down the formula. Write down a flow. State it is inequality hence folding should be done at time = 0 when it is flat, but nevertheless a binary decision. We characterize it by the sign. 
% One can then view a folding-bending process as a smooth flow, i.e. a smooth deformation on a piecewise C^2 developable surface. The choice to make each fold active is only done during time t = 0, whereas otherwise discontinuties arise, and locally remains a curved fold as the equality.
% Problem in using it for a DOG is that we cannot hope to get it exactly. Then present binary representation. Say how it's really good (also goes to zero very fast).
% The binary characterization in the smooth case, motivate more degrees of freedom, and add the algorithm. Then add control for dihedral angles and mountain valley fold.
\subsection{Discretization}
% Get a discrete picture for a fold, and then zoom in, to name the tangent.
