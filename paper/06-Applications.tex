Define the exact details, snapping, etc.

TODO: Explain here about what we do, flows similar to \cite{rabi2018shape}, just use lagrangian where the hessian is first convexified such that (called $H^*$) instead of the DOG Laplacian , which is basically SQP. Use the same strategy to minimally petrubate $J$ to $J^*$ as done in \cite{rabi2018shape}. Quickly go through the details such as merit functions (no need in the "projection" operator with lbfgs), and refer to the appendix for more technical things such as convexification of simple energies. 
At the end we write down our minimization as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:const_opt}
\begin{aligned}
& \argmin_x
& & f(x) \\
& \textrm{subject to}
& & g_i(x) = 0, \ \  i = 1, \ldots, m.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

By subsequently solving KKT systems of the form for a given mesh $x^k$, finding the step direction $d^{k+1}$:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:KKT_eps}
\begin{gathered}
{K} \begin{pmatrix} d^{k+1} \\ \lambda^{k+1} \end{pmatrix}=\mathbf{b} \\
{K}=\begin{pmatrix}
{H^*(x)+\sum\lambda_i^{k} \nabla g_i(x)} & {J^{*\tr}(x)}\\
{J^*(x)} &  0 \\
\end{pmatrix}, \ \ 
\mathbf{b}=\begin{pmatrix}
{\nabla f(x^k)} \\ 
\boldsymbol{-g(x^k)}\\
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}

and use a linesearch with a merit function. Say that hard constraints are only dog + edge stitching as in \cite{rabi18} whereas other constraints throughout the paper are enforced by penalizing them, using a convex hessian approximation of gauss-newton (besides the length which are easy to convexify).

%If $S$ is a curved folded surface with a given crease pattern, we call a crease \textit{active} at $S$ if there is a discontinuity along it.
