\section{Results} \label{sec:results}
\MiR{We use CGAL's arrangement model \cite{cgal,cgal_arr1,cgal_arr2} to compute a given planar arrangement from an input polyline, Paradiso (cite) to solve our linear systems), and libigl for other stuff. In our optimization we enforce a given dihedral angle constraint in an homotopy fashion by linearly interpolating the constrained angle from zero to $\theta^i$. Curve constrained stuff. \\}

%For rendering purposes, we keep another mesh where the extraneous parts of the duplicated faces are culled.
\subsection{Editing system}
\MiR{Important: Enforcing the folding constraint automatically choose M/V assignment (show figure). Also write it down in figures.}

Each crease pattern was deformed with the same positional constraints, induced by a curve constrained flow, but with a different mountain/valley assignment along one fold, enforced by \eqref{eq:mountain_valley}. In the lower banana shaped model the rest of the mountain/valley assignments are then uniquely determined.}

	\caption{Using the optional folding angle assignments (\secref{sec:folding_angle}) on a spare set of crease points. These examples were deformed by constraining the folding angle of a set of points (green), without specifying their folding orientation, and by setting a single positional constraint (blue).}
