We present a set of computational tools for unhindered exploration of curved folded sculptures, based on piecewise discrete orthogonal geodesic nets (DOGs). Our main apparatus is a discrete binary characterization for folds between DOGs, along with a simple folding algorithm to simultaneously enforce folding movements while deforming planar sheets. We complement our folding algorithm with essential building blocks for curved folding deformations: objectives to control dihedral angles, mountain-valley assignments, and rulings directions. The latter is accompanied with a novel discretization for vertex-based second fundamental forms on DOGs, a discrete torsion along the parameter lines and a theorem on local existence for fixed ruling deformations on single creased developables. We apply our machinery in a curved folding editing system and explore areas previously uncharted by computer simulations such as wallpaper curved folding, rigid folding, as well as dynamically adding, removing, and moving creases along a flattened pattern.
